Evolution and maintenance of cooperation with a spatial component is a topic with a variety of study domains. This meeting aims to bring together the experts in these various aspects. In particular the aim is to have a dialogue to strengthen the connection between the theory and experiments and to take stock of the current understanding of the field from both the perspectives. Bringing together experts from biology, economics, mathematics, physics and social sciences, we hope this results in an update of the theoretical standing as well as makes clear the assumptions which need to be tested experimentally.
