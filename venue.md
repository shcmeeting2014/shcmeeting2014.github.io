The meeting will be hosted at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology which is located in Plön in the state of Schleswig Holstein, Germany. Plön is the district seat of the Plön district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and has about 8,700 inhabitants. Plön is almost an island in the middle of 5 different (but mostly connected) lakes. The biggest one, the Grosser Plöner See (Great Plön Lake) has a circumference of almost 40 kms. The town's landmark is Plön Castle, a chateau built in the 17th century on a hill overlooking the town.

The town, nestled as it is in the rolling, wooded lake district of Holstein Switzerland (Holsteinische Schweiz), also has importance in the tourism industry.

The nearest towns are Kiel and Lübeck and the closest international airport is Hamburg, all well connected to Plön via train.
