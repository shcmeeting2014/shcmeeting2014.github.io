###Bio
Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
Princeton University

With a BA and PhD in Mathematics from Harvard, Corina works on how population structure affects the outcome of evolutionary processes, whether individuals interact at random, or whether they interact in well-defined networks, and how crucial are these in the understanding of biological interactions. Her work led to a general result that describes the effect of structure on evolution.
